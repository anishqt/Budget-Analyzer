# Budget-Analyzer

✨ Excited to share my latest project: A Simple Budget Analyzer! ✨

Managing finances can be challenging, so I built a Budget Analyzer app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allowed me to apply my front-end development skills to create something both practical and user-friendly.

# 🛠️ Features:

--> Track Income and Expenses: Users can log income and expenses with descriptions to stay on top of their finances.

--> Real-Time Balance Calculation: Displays total balance, income, and expenses instantly.

--> Transaction History: All transactions are listed, making it easy to review spending trends over time.

# 💡 What I Learned:

Working on this project improved my understanding of JavaScript functions, DOM manipulation, and styling with CSS. Creating a smooth user experience for budget management was a rewarding challenge!

# 📈 Next Steps:

I'm planning to enhance this project with:

--> Local Storage: So users can save their data.

--> Responsive Design: For a seamless experience on any device.
